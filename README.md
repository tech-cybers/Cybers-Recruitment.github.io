A simple phishing education page. 

Host your site for free on Git: 
  > Create a new repository and name it xxx.github.io
  > Upload files via ssh, bash - https option or manually using the upload link
  > Ensure your main html file is named 'index.html' and within the root folder. 
        This means that your repo tree would look like : xxx.github.io > index.html, page2.html, page3.html.....   
        
  > While in your repo, click on settings and head to the pages tab. 
        change your branch to main and save. Git will generate for you a link you can use to access your site.
